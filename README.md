## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was struggling to center my container. I learned to do that using flexbox. I also learned to link
external fonts in html.



### Useful resources

- [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) - This helped me with css with positioning container flexbox basics. I really liked using OpenAI. It provided answer quickly and it had alternative for every code. So I was able to chose the easy one and the one I understood due lack of my css knowledge.
- [Codepen](https://www.codepen.io) - This is an amazing website which helped me practice and test different ideas. With this website I don't have to worry about HTML templates. I can start by only writing necessary tags without worrying about standart HTML layout. That's really helpful for quick testing. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning HTML, CSS and JS.
